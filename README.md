# Bananas

Bananas is an all in one productivity app. It provides the core productivity feature of allowing users to create to do lists including the ability to add reminders to specific items in the to do list. Additionally, the to do list will have a priority system in place where the user can set a varying degree of priority for each item. This brings all the urgent items to the top of the to do list.
